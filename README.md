# HILFT-ASHP-README

## Introduction
This document provides comprehensive details of the datasets generated from the project titled, "Hardware-in-the-Loop Laboratory Performance Verification of Flexible Building Equipment in a Typical Commercial Building." This project is financially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under grant number EE-0009153. These datasets are obtained from extensive hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing of an Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) system at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), conducted under a diverse range of conditions and operational settings. Specifically, the methodology, building and system information, data points specifications, and test settings of different scenarios are included in this document.

## Methodology
The datasets in this repository were generated using an Air Source Heat Pump Hardware-In-the-Loop Flexible load Testbed (i.e., ASHP HILFT). Figure 1 depicts the overall framework of a HILFT, which mainly includes three parts: a virtual building model, a Grid-interactive Efficient Building (GEB) control model, and a hardware testbed. The virtual building model further includes a zone load model, an occupant comfort & behavior model, and an airflow model. More details about the development and integration of the HILFT can be found in XXX.
